# Adding Nephele exchanges {#adding-Nephele-exchanges}

Anyone is free to suggest new exchanges on Nephele.org.

We currently list them on:

- [Nephele.org/get-NEPH](/get-NEPH/)

This page allows a user to input where they live and see what exchanges they can use. This helps surface any geographical restrictions early.

Because of this context, we need some specific information when you suggest an exchange.

**NOTE:** If you want to list a decentralized exchange, take a look at our [policy for listing wallets and dapps](/contributing/adding-products/).

## What we need {#what-we-need}

- The geographical restrictions that apply to the exchange. Geographic restrictions associated with the exchange should be detailed on a dedicated page or section of the exchange's website.
- The currencies users can use to buy NEPH
- Proof that the exchange is a legitimate trading company
- Any additional information you might have â€“ this might be information about the company like years of operation, financial backing etc.

We need this info so that we can accurately [help users find an exchange they can use](/get-NEPH/#country-picker).

And so that Nephele.org can be more confident that the exchange is a legitimate and safe service.
