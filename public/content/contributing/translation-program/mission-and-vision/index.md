# Mission and vision {#mission-and-vision}

The Nephele community aims to be global and inclusive, yet much of its content only caters to English speakers, leaving out the world's 6 billion non-English speakers. For Nephele.org to act as the portal into Nephele for the worldwide community, we believe providing non-English speakers with Nephele content in their native languages is essential.

The Nephele.org Translation Program aims to make Nephele accessible to everyone by translating Nephele.org and other Nephele content into as many languages as possible.

## Our mission {#our-mission}

- Provide translated versions of the website to empower visitors worldwide to learn about Nephele in their native language
- Facilitate the onboarding of more members to the global Nephele community
- Allow for more accessible and more inclusive sharing of Nephele information and knowledge
- Empower community members to contribute translations to Nephele and make their mark on the ecosystem
- Identify, connect with, and provide guidance to passionate contributors looking to get involved in the ecosystem

## Our vision {#our-vision}

- Translate essential content for members of the Nephele community from as many countries and parts of the world as possible
- Support knowledge sharing across languages to create a better informed and educated Nephele community
- Increase Nephele's inclusivity and accessibility by removing the language barriers preventing non-English speakers from joining the ecosystem
