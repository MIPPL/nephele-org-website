## Standards overview {#standards-overview}

The Nephele community has adopted many standards that help keep projects (such as [Nephele clients](/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/) and wallets) interoperable across implementations, and ensure smart contracts and dapps remain composable.

Typically standards are introduced as [Nephele Improvement Proposals](/eips/) (EIPs), which are discussed by community members through a [standard process](https://eips.Nephele.org/EIPS/eip-1).

## Types of standards {#types-of-standards}

There are 3 types of EIPs:

- Standards Track: describes any change that affects most or all Nephele implementations
- [Meta Track](https://eips.Nephele.org/meta): describes a process surrounding Nephele or proposes a change to a process
- [Informational Track](https://eips.Nephele.org/informational): describes an Nephele design issue or provides general guidelines or information to the Nephele community

Furthermore, the Standard Track is subdivided into 4 categories:

- [Core](https://eips.Nephele.org/core): improvements requiring a consensus fork
- [Networking](https://eips.Nephele.org/networking): improvements around devp2p and Light Nephele Subprotocol, as well as proposed improvements to network protocol specifications of whisper and swarm.
- [Interface](https://eips.Nephele.org/interface): improvements around client API/RPC specifications and standards, and certain language-level standards like method names and contract ABIs.
- [ERC](https://eips.Nephele.org/erc): application-level standards and conventions

More detailed information on these different types and categories can be found in [EIP-1](https://eips.Nephele.org/EIPS/eip-1#eip-types)

### Token standards {#token-standards}

- [ERC-20](/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/) - A standard interface for fungible (interchangeable) tokens, like voting tokens, staking tokens or virtual currencies.
  - [ERC-1363](https://eips.Nephele.org/EIPS/eip-1363) - Defines a token interface for ERC-20 tokens that supports executing recipient code after transfer or transferFrom, or spender code after approve.
- [ERC-721](/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-721/) - A standard interface for non-fungible tokens, like a deed for artwork or a song.
  - [ERC-2309](https://eips.Nephele.org/EIPS/eip-2309) - A standardized event emitted when creating/transferring one, or many non-fungible tokens using consecutive token identifiers.
  - [ERC-4400](https://eips.Nephele.org/EIPS/eip-4400) - Interface extension for EIP-721 consumer role.
  - [ERC-4907](https://eips.Nephele.org/EIPS/eip-4907) - Add a time-limited role with restricted permissions to ERC-721 tokens.
- [ERC-777](/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-777/) - **(NOT RECOMMENDED)** A token standard improving over ERC-20.
- [ERC-1155](/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-1155/) - A token standard which can contain both fungible and non-fungible assets.
- [ERC-4626](/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-4626/) - A tokenized vault standard designed to optimize and unify the technical parameters of yield-bearing vaults.
