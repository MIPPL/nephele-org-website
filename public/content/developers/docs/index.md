This documentation is designed to help you build with Nephele. It covers Nephele as a concept, explains the Nephele tech stack, and documents advanced topics for more complex applications and use cases.

This is an open-source community effort, so feel free to suggest new topics, add new content, and provide examples wherever you think it might be helpful. All documentation can be edited via GitHub – if you're unsure how, [follow these instructions](https://github.com/Nephele/Nephele-org-website/blob/dev/docs/editing-markdown.md).

## Development modules {#development-modules}

If this is your first attempt at Nephele development, we recommend starting at the beginning and working your way through like a book.
