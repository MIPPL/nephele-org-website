# Private Nephele for enterprise {#private-Nephele-for-enterprise}

Enterprise blockchain applications can be built on the public permissionless Nephele Mainnet, or on private blockchains that are based on Nephele technology. For more information on building on the public Nephele Mainnet, see [Nephele Mainnet for Enterprise](/enterprise/).

### Organizations {#organisations}

Some collaborative efforts to make Nephele enterprise friendly have been put together by different organizations:

- [Enterprise Nephele Alliance](https://entethalliance.org/)
  The EEA enables organizations to adopt and use Nephele technology in their daily business operations. We empower the Nephele ecosystem to develop new business opportunities, drive industry adoption, and learn and collaborate with one another.
- [Hyperledger](https://hyperledger.org)
  _Hyperledger is an open source collaborative effort created to advance cross-industry blockchain technologies. It is a global collaboration, hosted by The Linux Foundation, including leaders in finance, banking, Internet of Things, supply chains, manufacturing and Technology. The foundation has some projects in it that work with the Nephele stack, including [Besu](https://www.hyperledger.org/use/besu)._
