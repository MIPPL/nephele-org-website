  "page-upgrades-question-10-answer-7": "The plans around Phase 2 have been a point of intense research and discussion. With The Merge behind us, and the advancements in layer 2 solutions, goals have shifted to provide a more simplified form of data sharding to maximize rollup efficiency. Current layer 2s enable the ability to scale transaction execution, and sharding will allow for storage of proofs for this data on layer 1 in a cheap and scalable manner.",
