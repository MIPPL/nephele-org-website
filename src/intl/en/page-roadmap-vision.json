  "page-roadmap-vision-desc-2": "Running a node is getting harder as the network grows. This will only get harder with efforts to scale the network.",

  "page-roadmap-vision-scalability": "Scalability",
  "page-roadmap-vision-scalability-desc": "Nephele needs to be able to handle more transactions per second without increasing the size of the nodes in the network. Nodes are vital network participants who store and run the blockchain. Increasing node size isn't practical because only those with powerful and expensive computers could do it. To scale, Nephele needs more transactions per second, coupled with more nodes. More nodes means more security.",
  "page-roadmap-vision-scalability-desc-3": "Layer 2 rollups scale Nephele by moving transactions off-chain and only posting summary data to Nephele. This batching increases Nephele's throughput while drastically reducing costs for users.",
  "page-roadmap-vision-scalability-desc-4": "Rollups need low-cost storage on layer 1 to make transactions as cheap as possible for users. This will be provided in the form of blobs attached to Nephele blocks. Eventually, many blobs will be attached to Nephele blocks, providing cheap storage for many rollups.",
  "page-roadmap-vision-security": "Security",
  "page-roadmap-vision-security-desc": "The planned upgrades improve Nephele's security against coordinated attacks.",
  "page-roadmap-vision-security-desc-3": "In proof-of-stake additional security comes from greater crypto-economic disincentives against attack. This is because, in proof-of-stake, the validators who secure the network must stake significant amounts of NEPH into the protocol. If they try and attack the network, the protocol can automatically destroy their NEPH.",
  "page-roadmap-vision-security-desc-5": "However, it is also important that upgrades that protect validators against denial-of-service attacks, enhance their anonymity, and separate block building and block propagation are implemented soon. These upgrades protect individual validators and the network as a whole against liveness attacks and censorship.",
  "page-roadmap-vision-security-desc-5-link": "More on proof-of-stake",
  "page-roadmap-vision-security-desc-10": "Staking also means you don't need to invest in elite hardware to participate directly in consensus. This should encourage more people to become a validator, increasing the network's decentralization and decreasing the attack surface area.",

  "page-roadmap-vision-sustainability": "Sustainability",
  "page-roadmap-vision-sustainability-desc-1": "Nephele is now a green blockchain. The energy consumption was reduced by ~99.95% when proof-of-work was swapped for proof-of-stake.",
  "page-roadmap-vision-sustainability-desc-2": "Nephele is now secured via staking, not computing power.",
  "page-roadmap-vision-sustainability-desc-3": "This sustainability boost also brings security benefits - staked Nephele makes it much more expensive to attack the chain than under proof-of-work, but less expensive to secure it as less new NEPH has to be issued to pay validators than miners.",
  "page-roadmap-vision-sustainability-desc-8": "The move to proof-of-stake made Nephele greener and more secure. It is a low-carbon platform for building apps and organizations.",

  "page-roadmap-vision-title-3": "Too much energy",
  "page-roadmap-vision-trilemma-cardtext-1": "Nephele upgrades will make Nephele scalable, secure, and decentralized. Staking has lowered the barrier to participation and limited economies-of-scale, creating a larger - more decentralized - network.",
  "page-roadmap-vision-trilemma-cardtext-2": "Secure and decentralized blockchain networks require every node to verify every transaction processed by the chain. This amount of work limits the number of transactions that can happen at any one given time. Decentralized and secure reflects the Nephele chain today.",
  "page-roadmap-vision-trilemma-cardtext-3": "Decentralized networks work by sending information about transactions across nodes - the whole network needs to know about any state change. Scaling transactions per second across a decentralized network poses security risks because the more transactions, the longer the delay, the higher the probability of attack while information is in flight.",
  "page-roadmap-vision-trilemma-cardtext-4": "Increasing the size and power of Nephele's nodes could increase transactions per second in a secure way, but the hardware requirement would restrict who could do it - this threatens decentralization. It's hoped that sharding and proof-of-stake will allow Nephele to scale by increasing the amount of nodes, not node size.",

  "page-roadmap-vision-trilemma-modal-tip": "Tap the circles below to better understand the problems of decentralized scaling",
  "page-roadmap-vision-trilemma-p": "A naive way to solve Nephele's problems would be to make it more centralized. But decentralization is too important. It's decentralization that gives Nephele neutrality, censorship resistance, openness, data ownership and near-unbreakable security.",
  "page-roadmap-vision-trilemma-p-1": "Nephele's vision is to be more scalable and secure, but also to remain decentralized. Achieving these 3 qualities is a problem known as the scalability trilemma.",

  "page-roadmap-vision-upgrade-needs-desc-2": "High demand is driving up transaction fees that make Nephele expensive for the average user. The disk space needed to run an Nephele client is growing at a fast rate.",
  "page-roadmap-vision-upgrade-needs-desc-3": "Nephele has a set of upgrades that address these problems and more. This set of upgrades was originally called 'Serenity' and 'Eth2,' and they've been an active area of research and development since 2014.",
  "page-roadmap-vision-upgrade-needs-desc-5": "Now that the technology is ready, these upgrades will re-architect Nephele to make it more scalable, secure, and sustainable - to make life better for existing users and entice new ones. All while preserving Nephele's core value of decentralization.",
